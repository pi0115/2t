my project is a website for a catering business, I currently work for part-time. I have created other websites for this business and they were so terrible. They looked nothing like this one. I know my site isnt fancy but I AM PROUD of it.
I used html and css and alot of my notes.
I know that I need to improve my CSS knowledge. I want to be able to add an "order-now site". I could have added more photos.
